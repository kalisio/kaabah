## Versioning

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.

When releasing a patch, minor or major version, i.e. the following tasks have to be done:
- increase the package version number in the package.json file
- create a tag accordingly in the git repository and push it

The command `npm run release:<type>`, where  `<type>` is either `patch`, `minor` or `major`, will do the job for you !
