# What is it ?

<b>Kaabah</b> is a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) based solution to build and operate [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) infrastructures either on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) or on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com). These infrastructures are bootstrapped with high level services such as [traefik](https://traefik.io/), [portainer](https://portainer.io/), [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [grafana](https://grafana.com/) in order to help you operate your cluster easily.

The Kaabah project was initiated by [Kalisio](https://kalisio.com) to provide us with the necessary tools to manage the different infrastructures we need to support our development.<br/><br/>
