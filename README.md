<b>Kaabah</b> is a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) based solution to manager a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) infrastructure either on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) or on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com). In addition, it powers your infrastructure with a stack of services such as [Traefik](https://traefik.io/), [portainer](https://portainer.io/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to let you exploit your cluster easily.
